##### Practicing Blockquotes, Using caret character ands Italics

I read this interesting quote the other day:

> "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"


>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
>He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.



>"He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were printed the words: _VIVE L'IRLANDE_!"

Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.  
If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

## Exercise 2

## **Markup Languages**

**CFML**:  
**ColdFusion Markup Language**, more commonly knonw as **CFML**, is a scripting language for web development that runs in the _JVM_, the _.NET framework_ and _Google App Engine_.  
Multiple commercial and open source implementations of CFML engines are available, including _Adobe ColdFusion_, _Lucee_, _New Atlanta BlueDragon_, _Railo_, and _Open BlueDragon_ as well as other _CFML server engines_.  
[More information on **CFML**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language)



**Fountain** (markup language)  
**Fountain** is a free and open_source plain text markup language that makes it possible to writa a formatted screenplay in any text editor, on any device, using any software that edits text files.  
Fountain (which got its name from _Fountain Avenue_, the famous Hollywood shortcut) was inspired by **John Gruber**'s Markdown, and has its origins in two different and non-related projects: _Scrippets_, developed by **John August** and **Nima Yousefi**, and _Screenplay Markdown_, developed by **Stu Maschwitz**.
